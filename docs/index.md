# Flywheel v2

Flywheel is a suite of open source token incentives and governance infrastructure using modern and modular solidity patterns to easily interface with other platforms.

It is built by the [Tribe DAO](http://tribedao.xyz/) using [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) and [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate).

Flywheel is completely on-chain and composable, for maximum compatibility with smart contract systems.

## Overview

Flywheel has two major components, the core incentives engine (including a suite of rewards modules and boosters) and ERC20 token utilities (xERC4626, ERC20MultiVotes, ERC20Gauges).

Production examples of the incentives engine:

- [fuse-flywheel](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fuse-flywheel) used to reward depositors to Fuse lending markets.
