# Flywheel v2

Flywheel is a suite of open source token incentives and governance infrastructure using modern and modular solidity patterns to easily interface with other platforms.

It is built by the [Tribe DAO](http://tribedao.xyz/) using [Foundry](https://github.com/gakonst/foundry) and [Solmate](https://github.com/Rari-Capital/solmate).

Flywheel is completely on-chain and composable, for maximum compatibility with smart contract systems.

## Overview

Flywheel has two major components:

- [the core incentives engine](./flywheel.md)
- [ERC20 token utilities (multi-votes and gauges)](./token-utilities.md)

Open source examples of the incentives engine:

- [fuse-flywheel](https://github.com/fei-protocol/fuse-flywheel) used to reward depositors to Fuse lending markets.

Open source examples of the ERC20 token utilities:

- [xTRIBE](https://github.com/fei-protocol/xTRIBE)
