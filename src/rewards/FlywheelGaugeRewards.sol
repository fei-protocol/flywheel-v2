/** 
 @title Flywheel Gauge Reward Stream
 @notice Distributes rewards from a stream based on gauge weights

 The contract assumes an arbitrary stream of rewards `S` of rewardToken. It chunks the rewards into cycles of length `l`.

 The allocation function for each cycle A(g, S) proportions the stream to each gauge such that SUM(A(g, S)) over all gauges <= S. 
 NOTE it should be approximately S, but may be less due to truncation.

 Rewards are accumulated every time a new rewards cycle begins, and all prior rewards are cached in the previous cycle.
 When the Flywheel Core requests accrued rewards for a specific gauge:
 1. All prior rewards before this cycle are distributed
 2. Rewards for the current cycle are distributed proportionally to the remaining time in the cycle. 
    If `e` is the cycle end, `t` is the min of e and current timestamp, and `p` is the prior updated time:
    For `A` accrued rewards over the cycle, distribute `min(A * (t-p)/(e-p), A)`.
